# Address Language

Address Language  developed by Ekaterina Logvinovna Yushchenko is a programming language designed to process complex hierarchical structures using an imperative programming style. This project includes a parser, a virtual machine (VM), and a code generator to facilitate the execution of programs written in Address Language.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kchernokozinsky/address-lang.git
   cd address-lang
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```sh
   cargo test
   ```

## Usage

To run a program written in Address Language, you need to use the provided VM and code generator.

1. **Write your Address Language program:**

   Create a file named `program.adl` and write your Address Language code in it.

2. **Generate bytecode:**

   Use the code generator to convert the Address Language code into bytecode.

3. **Execute the bytecode:**

   Run the bytecode using the VM.

## Modules

### Codegen

The codegen module is responsible for generating bytecode from Address Language source code. It traverses the abstract syntax tree (AST) and produces the corresponding bytecode instructions.

### Parser

The parser module parses the Address Language source code and produces an abstract syntax tree (AST). It includes:

- `ast.rs`: Contains the definition of the AST nodes and the visitor pattern for traversing the AST.
- `mod.rs`: The main module for the parser.
- `tests.rs`: Unit tests for the parser.

### VM

The vm module implements a virtual machine that executes the bytecode generated by the codegen module. It includes:

- `mod.rs`: The main module for the VM.
- `tests.rs`: Unit tests for the VM.

### Common

The common module contains utility functions and common code used across different modules. It includes:

- `util.rs`: Utility functions.
- `mod.rs`: The main module for common utilities.

### Value

The value module defines the Value type used to represent different types of values in the Address Language. It includes:

- `mod.rs`: The main module for value definitions.
- `tests.rs`: Unit tests for value types.

## Examples

Here are some examples of programs written in Address Language and how to run them.

### Example 1: Hello World

**Program:**

```mathematica
Print{"Hello, World!"}
```

**Bytecode:**

```rust
[
    Bytecode::Constant(Value::String("Hello, World!".to_string())),
    Bytecode::CallBuiltin("Print".to_string(), 1),
    Bytecode::Halt,
]
```
